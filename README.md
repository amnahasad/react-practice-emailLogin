# react-practice-emailLogin
In this email login application, the user can enter their email address and password to login. The user must enter a valid email address which is only valid if it includes the '@' symbol. If the user doesn't enter a valid email address and enters a password and continues to login, the user will be prompted to enter a valid email address. The password must be 7 digits or longer to be a valid password. While the user is typing into the text box for either the email address or password, the text box will remain red until the user has finished entering the valid input. If the user only enters a password and presses the 'Login' button, the email address text box becomes red and the user must enter a valid email address to procedd with the login. Similarly, if the user only enters the email address and presses the 'Login' button, the password text box will become red until the user enters a valid password. When both the email address and password are valid, the user can press the 'Login' button; this will then take the user to the 'Welcome back' page. The user can click the 'Logout' button to logout from this page, which will take them back to the login page.
